## Repository Responsiveness

Repositories are categorized based on their response patterns to improveit PRs.
Categories are determined by response time (time to first maintainer comment) and
acceptance rate (percentage of PRs merged vs closed without merge).

| Category | Count | Description |
|----------|-------|-------------|
| Welcoming | [4](Summaries/responsiveness/welcoming.md) | Fast response (<48h), high acceptance rate (>70%) |
| Selective | [19](Summaries/responsiveness/selective.md) | Moderate response time, reviews carefully before accepting |
| Unresponsive | [3](Summaries/responsiveness/unresponsive.md) | Slow or no response (>7 days average) |
| Hostile | [1](Summaries/responsiveness/hostile.md) | Quick rejection without engagement |
| Insufficient Data | [332](Summaries/responsiveness/insufficient_data.md) | Not enough PRs to categorize reliably |
